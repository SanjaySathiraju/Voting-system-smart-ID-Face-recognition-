# Voting-system-smart-ID-Face-recognition-

This is a python project for Windows. This code does not work on MacOS and still needs some development. 
Before getting started with the project, there are few libraries that needs to be installed. 
This project shows a voting system based on Unique ID and Iris Recognition. 
The system iimplementation is shown below:

The above figure depicts our proposed system model. In this model, the admin can log in and add the nominees and voters to the
database. Moreover, the admin can view the nominee and voters' details and election results. The voter also will log in with valid voter id and Iris images, and he/she can poll the vote if authenticated successfully, otherwise denied. 

Design::

The design of the system is primarily divided into two functionalities: Admin and voters. In the system, the admin, once given access, can operate various functions like adding a nominee, voters, and their iris images. Admin can also view results. When it comes to the voter, the only action that is allowed is casting a vote. Voters can log in with valid credentials such as Smart-ID and iris.
